### 1. Overview & Vision

if I am going to run a medical beauty clinclic, I plan to develop a mobile phone app which has the goals as followings:

#### A customer reservation and booking system :
  - a monthly and weekly calendar
  - customer can book the specific doctor's time slot and get confirmation.
  -  If doctor move the time slot, system will notify the customer and request customer redo the book job.
  -  If customer cancel the book, the system can free the time slot for other customers.
