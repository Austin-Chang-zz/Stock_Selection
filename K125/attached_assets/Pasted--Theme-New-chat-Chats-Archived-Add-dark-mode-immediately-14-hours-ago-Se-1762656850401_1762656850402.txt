I can see that your application already has dark mode CSS variables defined in index.css, but dark mode isn't currently enabled by default. I'll set it up so that dark mode is automatically active.

Why the app name on the app list of replit is still SmartHomeControl which is not related to any trading matters.

The app name shown in Replit's app list comes from the name field in package.json. Currently it's set to "rest-express", which is a generic template name. I'll update it to match your K12.5TradingSystem branding.

The error occurs because GitHub no longer accepts password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead.

Here's how to fix this:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
Go to GitHub.com and sign in
Click your profile picture → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
Give it a name like "K125TradingSystem"
Select scopes: at minimum check repo (full control of private repositories)
Click "Generate token"
Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
Step 2: Store the token securely in Replit Secrets
I'll guide you to use the Secrets tool to store your GitHub credentials:

Secrets
Store sensitive information (like API keys) securely in your App
Once you've added your secret:

Key: GIT_TOKEN
Value: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
Step 3: Push using the token
After adding the secret, run these commands in the shell:

git remote set-url origin https://Austin-Chang-zz:$GIT_TOKEN@github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125TradingSystem.git


Stop
Then push:

git push -u origin main


Stop
This will authenticate using your token stored in the secret, so you won't need to type credentials each time you push.

for shortening the app name, please change all app related name to K125

I can see the issue - you have an existing remote pointing to the old repository URL (K125TradingSystem). You need to update the remote URL to point to your new repository (K125) and use your GitHub token for authentication.

First, let's update the remote URL to point to the correct repository:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125.git


Stop
Now, to authenticate properly, you need to set up your GitHub Personal Access Token. First, add it to Replit Secrets:

Secrets
Store sensitive information (like API keys) securely in your App
Once you've added your GIT_TOKEN secret with your GitHub Personal Access Token, update the remote URL to include authentication:

git remote set-url origin https://Austin-Chang-zz:$GIT_TOKEN@github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125.git


Stop
Then push your changes:

git push -u origin main


Stop
Quick reminder: To create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
Click "Generate new token (classic)"
Give it a name and select the repo scope
Copy the token and add it as a secret in Replit with key GIT_TOKEN
Git is already initialized ✓
Your GitHub remote is configured as: https://github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125TradingSystem.git
There's a .git/index.lock file causing the sync issue
The problem: Git operations are blocked by a lock file, which typically happens when a previous git operation was interrupted.
my repo name had been changed to K125
how can I see the .git/index.lock ?

The .git/index.lock file is a hidden file in the .git directory that's preventing git operations. You can view it and remove it using shell commands.

First, let's check if the lock file exists:

ls -la .git/index.lock


Run again
If it exists, we can remove it (this is safe - it's just a stale lock file from an interrupted operation):

rm .git/index.lock


Run again
Then, let's update your remote URL to point to the new repository name:

git remote set-url origin https://Austin-Chang-zz:$GIT_TOKEN@github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125.git


Stop
After removing the lock file and updating the remote, you should be able to push your changes:

git push -u origin main


Stop
Note: Make sure you have your GIT_TOKEN secret set up in Replit Secrets (as mentioned in earlier steps) for the authentication to work.

Good news! The lock file has already been successfully removed (that's why you got "No such file or directory" in the last command). The lock is now gone.

Now let's update your git remote to point to your new repository name (K125) and push your changes:

git remote set-url origin https://Austin-Chang-zz:$GIT_TOKEN@github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125.git


Stop
Then verify the remote URL is correct:

git remote -v


Run again
Finally, push your changes:

git push -u origin main


Stop
Important: Make sure you have your GitHub Personal Access Token stored in Replit Secrets with the key GIT_TOKEN. If you haven't done this yet, add it through the Secrets tool before running the push command.

I can see you're trying to check the git remotes, but there's a typo in your command. You wrote reomtes instead of remotes. Let me help you check the correct remote configuration:

git remote -v


Run again
This will show you the current remote URLs. As we can see from the previous output, your remote is still pointing to the old repository name K125TradingSystem. Let's update it to point to your new repository name K125:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125.git


Stop
Then verify the change:

git remote -v


Run again
After updating the remote URL, if you want to push your changes and you have your GitHub Personal Access Token stored in Replit Secrets as GIT_TOKEN, you can use:

git remote set-url origin https://Austin-Chang-zz:$GIT_TOKEN@github.com/Austin-Chang-zz/K125.git


Stop
Then push:

git push -u origin main


Stop
If you haven't set up your GIT_TOKEN secret yet, you'll need to add it through the Secrets tool first.

Enable "Accessible Terminal" in Workspace Settings to use a screen reader with the shell.
Unsupported state: your index is currently locked. This can happen if multiple git processes are running operations at the same time.
Please resolve the issue by ending those git operations. If you are sure you do not have git operations running, you can delete your .git/index.lock file.
